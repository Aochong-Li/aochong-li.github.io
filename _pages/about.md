I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Cornell University. I work on Natural Langauge Processing and Machine Learning. I received my undergraduate degree from Columbia University, where I became interested in NLP and I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/" style="text-decoration:none">Zhou Yu</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smara/" style="text-decoration:none">Smaranda Muresan</a>. Before Cornell, I worked as a quant researcher in Global Stock Selection team at <a href="https://www.aqr.com/" style="text-decoration:none">AQR Capital Management</a> for a year. For more details, please see my <a href="/files/Aochong_Li_CV.pdf" style="text-decoration:none">CV</a>.

My legal name is Aochong, but my friends have always called me Oliver, which I used on my publications while at Columbia.

I am recently interested in the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-act-two/" style="text-decoration:none">"Act 2"</a> in the era of AI revolution. ChatGPT is introduced in 2022, and now is 2024. I think this wave of technology revolution has a lot of similarities to the dot com revolution in the 90s. 1. people are amazed by the power of this new technology and have strong conviction that it is gonna change the future but have little idea of how. 2. a plethora of similar startups doing similar products and involve a lot of competitions and many unrelated companies will have their valuations double just by dropping a ".ai" at the end of their company name 3. it is unclear who is gonna be the big winner and big loser (openai used to be leading the industry fronotier by a big margin compared the second one in race, but now with meta, anthropic, google, mistral, ... catching up very quickly)

Maybe we are in another big investment bubble over an over-hyped technology. The more important question to ask is: after the bubble bursts, should we still do AI? And, what should be the Act 2 in this era of revolution after Act 1 (aka foundation model arms race).
